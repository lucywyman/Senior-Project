\section{The Problems}
	Grading assignments is a time intensive task for TAs or 
	instructors. In addition, students may not receive feedback
	until after they can no longer make use of it to improve their work.
    Other forseeable issues include security risks of running 
    arbitrary code on a valuable machine, and a potentially
    prohibitive lack of user-friendliness for teachers or 
    students.

\section{The Solution}
	Create an automated grading system that gives students immediate 
	feedback, while mitigating the risks of running unknown code.
    Our solution should also be easy to use as an administrator
    creating a test suite, and as a student using the test suite,
    through both a graphical and command line interface (GUI and CLI).

\section{The Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Grading assignments for correctness is not a great use of 
        instructor or TA time. Additionally it is very boring. 

    \item There is often a long delay between when material is taught 
        and when students or instructors get feedback on if students 
        actually understood it.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a back-end that can securely run arbitrary code 
        provided by a 3rd party client through integration and unit 
        tests. 

    \item Create a client CLI front end to allow submission of code 
        to the server and the viewing of test results.

    \item Create a web based GUI front end to allow submission of 
        code to the server and the viewing of test results. 

    \item Create an admin CLI to manage the addition, updating and 
        deleting tests, check on test submissions and results.

    \item Create a web based interface to administrate the database 
        it would have similar functionality to the CLI version.
\end{enumerate}

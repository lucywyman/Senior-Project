Project Abstract\\

\section{The Problems}
	Grading assignments is a time intensive task for TAs or 
	instructors. In addition, students may not receive feedback
	until after they can no longer make use of it to improve their work.

\section{The Solution}
	Create an automated grading system that gives students immediate 
	feedback, while mitigating the risks of running unknown code.
